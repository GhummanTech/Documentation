Students can revisit concepts, pause, and analyze at their convenience to grasp concepts thoroughly—an especially significant advantage for students with learning disabilities.

Virtual classrooms prove to be a goldmine of resources. From eBooks, online journals, video content to interactive games, and multimedia presentations, they offer a plethora of digital learning resources. The integration of multimedia content and simulations can make learning more engaging and interactive, raising the quality and depth of learning experiences altogether.

However, given the rapid pace of technological evolution and the increased focus on bridging the digital divide and increasing digital literacy, it is likely that these challenges will be mitigated in time. It's also essential to ensure a balanced approach with adequate opportunities for physical interaction, crucial for social skills and overall development.
