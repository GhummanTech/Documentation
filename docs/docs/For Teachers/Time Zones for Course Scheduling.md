# Time Zones for Course Scheduling

When scheduling classes on Ghumman Tech, we ensure both **teachers and students see times in their local time zones** for clarity and convenience.

---

## 🕒 How Time Zones Work

- When **teachers select a timeslot**, it is automatically based on the **local timezone of their device** (computer, tablet, or phone).
- Our system **converts the selected timeslot to the student’s local timezone** before displaying it to them.

There is **no need to manually convert** between time zones — Ghumman Tech handles that for you!

---

## ✅ Example

> A teacher in New York selects a class time of **4:00 PM EST**.  
> A student in California will see that class scheduled at **1:00 PM PST**.

This ensures all users see times that make sense **in their own location**.

## 💡 Tip for Teachers

Make sure your device’s time zone is set correctly to avoid confusion when picking class times.
