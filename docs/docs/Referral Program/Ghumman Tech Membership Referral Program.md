# Ghumman Tech Membership Referral Program

Welcome to the **Ghumman Tech Membership Referral Program** — a simple and rewarding way to share learning and earn gift cards!

## 🎁 How It Works

Every Ghumman Tech user can **generate a unique custom referral code**, which they can share with friends and family. When someone uses your referral link to purchase a **yearly membership**, both of you will receive a **$5 gift card via email**.

### ✅ Key Points

- You can **create your own referral code**, and a unique link is generated for you.
- Share your referral link **as many times as you want** — there are no limits!
- When someone signs up for the **yearly membership ($99/year)** using your referral link:
  - They **pay the full $99**.
  - After their **7-day free trial ends**, both of you receive a **$5 gift card** by email.
- **Monthly memberships are not eligible** for referral rewards.
- **Gift cards are only issued after the trial period ends**, and the membership becomes active.

## 🔗 Your Referral Link

Your referral link will look like this:

https://www.ghummantech.com/BuyMembership?ref=538Z871N


You can replace `538Z871N` with **your unique referral code**.

### Best Places to Share:

- Social media platforms like **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **WhatsApp**, and **X (Twitter)**
- **Friends and family groups**
- **Email signatures**, blogs, or online bios

> The more you share, the more gift cards you earn. There’s **no limit** on how many people can use your code.
