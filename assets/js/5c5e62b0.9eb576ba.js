Using effective instructional design principles, these platforms create realistic situations that require negotiating. Students are often paired or put into groups where they need to negotiate on various issues or reach a consensus. Real-life scenarios that mirror business negotiation or conflict resolution strategies are simulated, challenging students to evaluate, strategize, and implement negotiation principles in solving problems. This provides a practical, hands-on approach to understanding the dynamics of negotiation and enhancing interpersonal skills."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Additionally, online learning platforms utilize features such as webinars, live interactive sessions, and discussion forums where industry experts or experienced negotiators guide learners. Techniques of persuasive communication, the art of compromise, critical thinking, decision-making, strategic planning, and other relevant skill sets are imparted to the learners.
