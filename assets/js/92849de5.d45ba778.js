Regardless of the numerous benefits, online education demands a tributary of resilience, an essential skill that students must possess for effective learning in this platform."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity, plays an integral role in online education. Often overlooked, resilience is a cornerstone trait underpinning academic achievement and student well-being.

From making the best use of technology-based learning tools, collaborating with peers in a virtual environment to adaptive learning without physical supervision, there are numerous challenges that students may face. These challenges are complimented with peculiar personal life difficulties amid the pandemic, ranging from financial distress to social isolation. The ability to navigate these complexities and continue learning requires students to be resilient."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Technology breakdowns are commonplace in an online learning environment.

Resilient learners respond to these issues by remaining composed and seeking alternative solutions, thus ensuring that their learning journey remains uninterrupted."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Self-motivation is another challenge in online learning. Unlike traditional classroom environments, online learning often lacks direct human interaction and supervision. The relationship between teachers and students, and amongst peers, is largely mediated by screens which can sometimes feel impersonal and disconnected. This can leech motivation from a student and undermine learning achievements. Resilient students, however, are adept at managing their motivation and commitment to learn, keeping procrastination and demotivation at bay."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Moreover, an important aspect of online learning is the nature of feedback, which can be impersonal and occasionally misinterpreted.
