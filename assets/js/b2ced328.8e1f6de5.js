Today, the global education community lauds the rise of online education as it brings knowledge closer to learners regardless of geographical boundaries and financial limitations. With the ubiquitousness of digital devices and the internet, earning a degree or learning a new skill has never been more accessible. But what does this mean for the conventional brick-and-mortar classrooms? Are we seeing the end of traditional education, or is this just the start of more innovative, hybrid learning methods?"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Online education, or edtech, has made knowledge widely available to individuals who would not ordinarily have access due to financial, geographic, or socio-economic constraints. Many prestigious institutions have begun offsetting the limitations of traditional education by offering online degree programs and certificate courses. This trend has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the adaptability and resilience of online learning models."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Furthermore, edtech companies are leveraging advancements in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to shape a new frontier in online education.

These innovative tools enhance learning resources, make instructions more effective, and raise future readiness among today's learners."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The rise of online education could easily stoke fears about the demise of traditional classrooms. However, rather than viewing these two mediums as mutually exclusive or competitive, it seems more practical and innovative to regard them as complementary elements that together create a more comprehensive, integrated approach to education. The future of education holds the promise of harnessing the best aspects of both modes to build an enriched learning ecosystem."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Traditional classrooms offer invaluable face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, a sense of community, direct feedback, and real-time clarification of doubts.

Blended learning or hybrid learning, as it's popularly known, holds the potential to offer the best of both worlds."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In such integrated learning models, a significant proportion of the curriculum is delivered online for the individual learner's convenience.
