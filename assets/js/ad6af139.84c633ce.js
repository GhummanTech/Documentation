Online learning is no longer a luxury but a crucial necessity for the modern world, especially since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we step into a new era, the digital divide seems to pose a significant challenge. However, the rise of online learning is playing a pivotal role in bridging this gap, creating a more inclusive educational infrastructure for all."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(i.p,{children:"The digital divide refers to the chasm that exists between those with ready access to computers and the internet, and those without. This disparity is primarily driven by socioeconomic factors such as income, education, and demographic variables and can lead to significant inequities, especially in the educational sector. Online learning is progressively bridging this digital gap by simplifying access to education and resources."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Firstly, online learning is revolutionizing education by making it more accessible. It isn't limited by geographical boundaries, thus providing opportunities to students anywhere in the world. Now, they can participate in a course at Harvard or Oxford without being physically present, all thanks to the power of online education. Moreover, it offers flexible scheduling that can be tailored around personal or work commitments, making education achievable for those who may not be able to adhere to traditional classroom timings."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Additionally, online platforms present a wide array of educational resources.
