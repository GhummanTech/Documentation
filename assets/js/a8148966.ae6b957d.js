Online education is breaking traditional barriers and highlighting the progressive march of digitization in the learning sector. One of the most crucial challenges it continues to alleviate is the financial restrictions that many students face."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Traditionally, quality education has been closely associated with high costs. Be it the sky-high tuition fees of colleges or the hefty payments for extra-curricular courses, students were often forced to compromise on their educational aspirations due to financial constraints. However, the advent of learning platforms on the internet is rapidly changing this narrative."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Firstly, online education provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional classroom learning. Online learning platforms eliminate physical infrastructure and pass on these cost savings to the students. Not only does it remove the cost of commuting, but online courses also come at a fraction of the price of conventional classroom programs."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Moreover, online learning promotes 'education for all' by providing access to quality resources and educators from across the world without the restrictions of geography.
