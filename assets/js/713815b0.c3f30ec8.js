One such overlooked benefit is how it effectively fosters a growth mindset among students."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"A growth mindset, unlike a fixed mindset, believes in the potential for intelligence growth. Instead of viewing intelligence as a static trait, we can develop it over time through effort, practice, and resilience.

They learn to become more proactive, taking charge of their learning experience, setting personal goals, and strategizing approaches to reach them. Traditional classroom environments often safeguard predetermined paths. In contrast, online learning, with its fluid structure, demands students to be more engaged, adaptive, and independent. In many ways, it drives home the essence of a growth mindset\u2014embracing challenges, persisting in the face of setbacks, and seeing effort as a pathway to mastery."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Moreover, online learning platforms often incorporate gamified elements such as badges, leaderboards, or progress trackers.
