Traditional classrooms often inadvertently create segregation based on differences. These can range from language, culture, race, abilities, or even personality traits like introversion. But online learning transcends these boundaries, as it largely focuses on a student\u2019s ability to grasp and engage with the subject matter than anything else.

Students are not restricted to interacting only with those in their immediate environment.

They also give introverted students, who might feel overwhelmed in in-person settings, the chance to participate and engage more comfortably."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lastly, the transparency and accessibility of online learning is bridging the gap between teachers and students.
