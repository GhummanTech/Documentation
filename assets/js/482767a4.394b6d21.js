This flexibility can allow the learner to balance their education with other commitments, like a part-time job or family responsibilities.

In traditional classrooms, every student has to move at the predefined pace set by the teacher. However, with e-learning platforms, students follow their rhythm, focusing more on the challenging concepts and swiftly moving through the ones they grasp quickly. This approach does more than just personalize the learning experience - it actively teaches students how to manage their time effectively.
