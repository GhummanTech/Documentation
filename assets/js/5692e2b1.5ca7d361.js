Learning a new language is no longer confined to a physical classroom but rather in the world of digital education where we can access language courses at our fingertips. With the rise of online learning, the process of acquiring a new tongue has become flexible, convenient, and customized, and the teaching techniques employed are often tailored to an individual's unique learning style."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Online learning platforms have instilled a sense of flexibility in language learning, which was otherwise difficult to witness. Traditional classrooms require learners to adjust their daily schedules to attend language classes, often making it difficult for busy individuals to participate. However, online learning provides the opportunity to learn at your own pace, at a suitable time, and even in the comfort of one\u2019s own home.

Everyone has a unique style of learning, and online platforms have leveraged this fact to revolutionize language learning.

Traditional classrooms, with their one-size-fits-all model, often struggle to offer such a high degree of personalization."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Online platforms also provide an abundance of resources for practice and revision. Many offer an extensive range of eBooks, podcasts, videos, quizzes, and even forum discussions.

This accessibility to infinite materials is exclusive to digital learning, a benefit not available in traditional classes with limited textbooks and handouts."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Moreover, technology has made it possible to practice speaking and listening to the language in question with language learning apps.
