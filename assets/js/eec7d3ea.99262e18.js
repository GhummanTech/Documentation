Unlike 'hard skills' like maths, science, or language fluency, which are often the focus of traditional education, soft skills encompass attributes such as communication abilities, problem-solving skills, critical thinking, leadership, adaptability, and work ethic. These skills are essential for students to excel not only in academic pursuits but also in their future professions."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"There is an ever-increasing demand in the workplace for employees who possess these soft skills.
