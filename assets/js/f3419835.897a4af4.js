Firstly, this pedagogical modality typically requires learners to take ownership of their education. The flexibility and convenience offered necessitate self-discipline, agency in decision making, and autonomous learning, which all contribute to the development of a growth mindset."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Online courses often use formative assessments, which provide instant feedback and let students monitor their progress. This allows them to recognize areas where they are doing well and those where improvements are needed, without waiting for a mid-term or final exam.

Educators play a pivotal role in fostering this perspective. Teachers can inspire a growth mindset by providing regular, meaningful feedback that is focussed on effort, learning strategies, and progress rather than grades. They can set high expectations and then offer the necessary support to help students reach them. Moreover, educators can model a growth mindset themselves by emphasizing that they\u2019re learners, too."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In these unprecedented times, online learning presents an opportunity.
