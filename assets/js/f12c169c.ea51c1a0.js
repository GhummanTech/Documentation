They are used to games, rewards, and social interaction online. E-learning platforms are incorporating gamification, quizzes, and peer-to-peer interaction to keep the learning experience engaging and fun. The use of VR and AR technologies also translate traditional theoretical concepts into practical, hands-on experiences which are highly effective for comprehension and retention."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lastly, Gen Z values authenticity and social responsibility. They desire to see real-world applicability of what they are learning, and they thrive on making a positive impact. Therefore, online platforms are incorporating project-based learning, live industry projects, and courses focused on social issues and sustainability."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It's also worth noting that Gen Z has inherited from their millennial predecessors a penchant for self-learning and entrepreneurship. They are explorers who use the internet as their compass. Online platforms are tapping into this trait by providing self-paced courses and encouraging self-driven, project-based learning."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Online learning platforms are thus moving from being mere content providers to creators of dynamic, interactive learning environments suitable for Gen Z. They're becoming more flexible, interactive, and personalized, reengineering the learning experience and making it contemporary, relevant, and enjoyable.
