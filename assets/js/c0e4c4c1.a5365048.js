Online education is not limited to technical skills or theoretical knowledge anymore. In fact, it has experienced exponential growth in one of the most unexpected areas: soft skills training."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Soft skills, unlike hard skills, are not about the knowledge you possess but rather about your interpersonal traits such as communication, teamwork, leadership, empathy, adaptability, and much more.

This underscores the importance of soft skills training in online education."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"While online platforms are replete with courses offering hard technical skills, the introduction of soft skills training is a game-changer. We live in a world where artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are rapidly replacing manual tasks. In this setting, individuals equipped with soft skills are the ones who stand out. A software engineer, for instance, might have the requisite coding knowledge, but without efficient communication skills, team collaboration, and resilience, the tech-savvy professional might face difficulties to thrive and advance in their career."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Online education is key to unlocking this treasure trove of soft skills.

Therefore, online education platforms should strive to offer comprehensive training programs that cater to both hard and soft skills, ensuring that learners are fully equipped for the future of work."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,o.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}}}]);
