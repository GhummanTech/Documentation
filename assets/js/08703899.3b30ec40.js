Virtual learning crosses borders and time zones, making education accessible to many who otherwise would miss out. But in this vast interconnected web of knowledge and learning, it\u2019s easy for our online interactions to feel transactional and devoid of emotional connection. This is where the importance of gratitude comes in."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Gratitude is a reciprocal act of acknowledgement that recognizes another person\u2019s effort or good deeds. It\u2019s a simple concept that brings significant benefits to both individuals involved. Expressing gratitude not only makes the receiver feel appreciated but also enriches the giver's life by enhancing stress resilience and fostering a happier sense of well-being."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In the realm of online education, gratitude takes on a different layer of importance. Adapting to online learning can be stressful for both educators and students alike. Students grapple with keeping themselves motivated, and educators with the challenge of creating engaging content without the immediacy of physical classroom feedback. Here is how practicing gratitude can significantly change the dynamics of virtual classrooms."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"For students, acknowledging the efforts of the educators with words or messages of gratitude makes the learning process more human.
