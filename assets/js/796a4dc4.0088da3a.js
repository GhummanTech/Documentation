Hence, each student gets a taste of the unique challenges and learning curves faced by other individuals who could be located in different parts of the world. This exposure helps in promoting a broader awareness and understanding of diversity, enabling an enriched empathetic outlook."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Online learning necessitates active communication and collaboration in various formats such as chat forums, webinars, group projects, etc. This collaborative mode of learning involves students interacting and problem-solving with peers who might have different perspectives, opinions or approaches.

It also plays a significant role in helping students develop empathy, understanding, and respect for diverse experiences, perspectives, and challenges.
