These platforms are not only providing easy access to vast knowledge hubs at a click, but also nurturing critical soft skills among students. Among these skills, one that stands remarkably noted is teamwork. In traditional classrooms, teamwork is often limited to in-person group projects and class activities. However, online learning platforms have been ingeniously reinventing the concept of collaborative learning and teamwork skills."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Online learning platforms utilize a variety of tools and methodologies that facilitate team collaborations. One of the most significant features of these platforms is the use of virtual breakout rooms for group tasks and discussions. Regardless of geographic components, students are now able to interconnect and collaborate, truly bridging the gap between them. This eradicates the boundaries of conventional classrooms and enables smoother communication and exchange of ideas among diverse minds."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In addition to live interaction rooms, these platforms also offer interactive tools that allow students to work together on projects in real-time. Tools such as Google Docs, Trello, and Slack amongst others, permit learners to brainstorm, strategize, divide responsibilities, share feedback, and more, without the constraint of physical proximity. Group tasks taken up on these platforms encourage participants to collectively problem-solve, negotiate, delegate, and coordinate \u2013 all essential elements of effective teamwork."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Then there's social learning. Online learning platforms are creating forums for discussions and knowledge sharing where students can post comments, share resources, or ask questions.
