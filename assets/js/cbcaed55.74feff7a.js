As the global smartphone usage projections predict a rise to 6.4 billion users by 2021, the potential reach of m-learning rises with it. This is particularly significant considering the digital divide that exists due to socio-economic factors; m-learning does not require expensive hardware and can be accessed through low-cost smartphones available to a vast number of people in even the most remote corners of the world."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Moreover, the pedagogical benefits of mobile learning make it a compelling tool for the future of education.
